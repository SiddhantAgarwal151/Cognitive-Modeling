    "1. Forward - Ice Melting into a puddle, very easy computationally \\\n",
    "Backward - Trying to figure out what a puddle looked like as ice, given the many different possible starting states it is infeasible to compute\n",
    "2. Forward - Calculating where a paper airplane will land given wind conditions, easy enough with good models \\\n",
    "Backward - Calculating the wind based on where a paper airplane landed, a far more difficult problem due to the many paths it could have taken\n",
    "3. Forward - Conways Game of Life, incredibly easy computationally \\\n",
    "Backward - Finding the starting orientation of a finshed Game of Life, much more complex and impossible to know if you've arrived at the right conclusion"
